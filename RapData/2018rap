I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henney and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything, oh whoa
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (what's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed (matter how my life has changed)
I keep on looking back on better days
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything, oh whoa

I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
$2, 500 for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngin's come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jew, he like his voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm Lil Baby
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawgs goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawgs going all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Wheezy out of here
