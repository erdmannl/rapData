It's going down, I'm yelling timber

Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like the what, timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on plane
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now, Voli

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me, heartache
I'm gonna lie to you, I'm gonna lie to you
Gonna lie to you, gonna lie to you
Like a black widow, baby
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something liking to loving
It was us against the world now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You was different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me, heartache
I'm gonna lie to you, I'm gonna lie to you
Gonna lie to you, gonna lie to you
Like a black widow, baby
I'm gonna love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doing whatever works
You'd have never met nobody
That will do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus hallelujah
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breath for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air
And you leave for it
Til then having kids, can check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me, heartache
I'm gonna lie to you, I'm gonna lie to you
Gonna lie to you, gonna lie to you
Like a black widow, baby
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle

I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like

Somethin' wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'ma still make sure that she douche it
Me and my rollie, we don't get caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J
(Who said money?)
Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches and yawnin'
Hey, this a show bitch you performin'
I do this shit for my daughters and all my sons, bitch
Hop on a random bands, I'll take out their funds, bitch
I got a moms bitch, she got a moms bitch
I got sisters and brothers to feed
I ain't goin' out like no idiot, I'm a OG
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like volcano
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
Still screamin' "Fuck the otherside"
I'ma ride for my niggas, aye
And I'ma die for my niggas, aye
Ain't gonna be latching on my niggas boy
Niggas couldn't see me if they had a genie
I'ma live my life like Beanie, R.I.P. my brother Beanie
I stack my racks to the ceiling, now these niggas can't beat me
I just might wake up when Chanel and these bitches can't see me
I'm in a whole other league
I ain't got aids but I swear to God I would bleed
'Til I D.I.E
28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
I'm in that coffin with baby mommy gettin' sloppy toppy
I'm bleedin' red like a devil, I see these bitches plotting
They wanna know how I got M's and I ain't finish college
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like volcano
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
I do it for my daddy, I do it for my mama
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up
And well I be beating on my chest, in the jungle, aye
Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grindin' with no sleep
Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way
Thugger Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, I'll do her, I want a head, Medusa
I swear a nigga gone cause this strong I'm blowin' super
Grindin' for a new day
I'm skatin', like that nigga Lupe
Hey, I'm on the top just like toupee
Hey, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like volcano
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'

When she took it, I took it back, you shoulda asked for a Benz
That’s mediocre bitch!

Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme six inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil' with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last hoe
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that dumb dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I’m looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit, what she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around, give a damn who you do it with
Super thick, pretty face, ménage à veinte
Twenty at the same time, wanna get ya' rent paid?
All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre hoe
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre hoe

Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check

More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m hip-hop hooray
My hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I’m ’bout to turn up now

Flu game twelve, Space Jam 11

All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's

I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m hip-hop hooray
