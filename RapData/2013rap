I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome.
Walk into the club like "What up? I got a big cock!"
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like "Damn, that's a cold ass honky!"
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Ah, he got the Velcros!"
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button
Up shirt, ‘cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!"
I'm like "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up

From that thrift shop down the road

From that thrift shop down the road

I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
Return of the Mac, get em
What it is
What it does
What it is
What it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking out who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game nope nope y’all can’t copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking
This here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I’m on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But, I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here
Nah they can’t tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Nah they can’t tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Now can I kick it, thank you
Yeah I’m so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y’all can’t stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little
speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw, time to go off, I'm gone!
Deuces goodbye, I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar make you a believer
Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching I said
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why I love you so much, oh
You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love it so much, yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Uh, Blue told me remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y’all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
Bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
'Nough to make me wanna murder, mama please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Know we all just entertainers
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit just ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived
Still getting bigger nigga living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa, illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
You get the air out my lungs, whenever you need it
And you take, the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleeding, I still don’t know why (don't know why)
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And you play this game, in spite, to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink, with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Don't know why

Baby we can travel the world

OK, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent? Had a thing for you
Even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you, I'm saying
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya
And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are, all I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are (she got me)
And we are we are we are (she got me)
Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla', dolla'
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall, each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever, but
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya, yeah

Got me open all night hey
When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw,
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like,
"Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K"
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like "Yeah, I'm good a little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3, 500 hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
"Man that's gay" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins,
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (Not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, (Not crying on Sundays) love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, (Not crying on Sundays) love is kind(I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, (Not crying on Sundays) love is kind(I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind
I heard about you
You heard about me?
Haha, yeah, what, haha
Cause I had some issues
Back at ya, bad girl
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did
But I sure know how to fuck ya, I be
Yeah hold up, bad girls ain't no good,
And the good girls ain't no fun
Look (And the bad girls want a real nigga!)
Yeah, cause real niggas just want (ha)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roll never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)
Yeah in the literal sense, I mean the physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that I heard you (bad girl)
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass
We at that bed, floor, couch, hold up
(Loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what's up? (Whats up?)
Forget it, 'cause you know the bad girls always unapologetic
Is it bad that, I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you
She hurt feelings, she ain't wrong
She work hard, she play harder
Got a smart mouth, like a speed fly
She don't catch feelings she too busy catching G5
She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent
Gone blaze up, take the wheel Jah
And Rhianna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost (Cause I've had some issues)
Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Psh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them
Ain't no IG, but she follow K
And we at that bed, floor, couch, hold up

Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you (bad to you)
I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless i get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said i was driving reckless
You and I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh no i can't stop i was destined
I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And i put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality see when your blessed just kill critics
Buggatti never when im rich, just god fearing
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring
Gotta good feeling, plus the right caring, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers i know you wouldn't panic
I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now
I think of letting go
(I know caught up in the middle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go
when I think of letting go
(Oh no gave up on the riddle I cry, just a little when I think of letting go)
